description: Polish Chinese webnovel chapters and planning documents for publication-style readability. Use when rewriting prose, dialogue, and pacing in long-form serial fiction; when converting script-like text into natural narrative; when enforcing in-world terminology consistency (native characters vs system UI language); and when optimizing chapter hooks, arc rhythm, and milestone progression in outlines or manuals.

# Webnovel Polish

## Workflow

1. Read target files and classify issues:
- prose issues (script-like tags, stiff narration, repeated sentence patterns)
- world consistency issues (native characters using game UI language)
- plot issues (flat chapter endings, weak mini-climax cadence)

2. Rewrite with webnovel narrative baseline:
- Prefer direct dialogue with action/gesture anchors.
- Avoid explicit broadcaster tags like `某某说：` in every line.
- Keep one dominant viewpoint anchor per scene.
- Insert micro-transitions every 2-4 dialogue turns.

3. Enforce terminology layering:
- Keep game terms (`Lv`, damage numbers, priority, panel stats) inside system UI blocks or protagonist cognition.
- Use Naruto-world terms for native characters (`下忍/中忍/上忍/影级`, 查克拉, 血继限界, 危险等级).
- Convert leaked game jargon in native dialogue to in-world equivalents.

4. Optimize pacing and hooks:
- Ensure each chapter has one clear conflict axis and one payoff axis.
- End chapters with forward pressure (new threat, new objective, new cost).
- Use 5-chapter rhythm for serial momentum: `2推进 + 1战斗/冲突 + 1情感/关系 + 1钩子收束`.

5. Run final checks:
- No script scaffolding markers (`场景：`, `旁白`, `核心爽点`, `下一章预告`) in正文.
- No native-character lines with raw game panel speech.
- Dialogue readability stable on mobile (short paragraphs, clear speaker turns).

## Output Standard

- Keep plot facts unchanged unless user asks for structural changes.
- Preserve chapter title and sequence.
- Prioritize continuity, clarity, and emotional momentum over ornamental prose.

## References

- Read [references/style-baseline.md](references/style-baseline.md) for concrete prose and dialogue rules.
- Read [references/plot-optimizer.md](references/plot-optimizer.md) when editing outlines, milestone maps, or handbook-style planning docs.
