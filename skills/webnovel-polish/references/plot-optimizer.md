# Plot Optimizer

## 1) Chapter-Level Check

- Define one primary conflict per chapter.
- Define one payoff per chapter.
- End with forward pressure.

## 2) Five-Chapter Rhythm

- Chapter A: setup and objective
- Chapter B: escalation
- Chapter C: confrontation or tactical clash
- Chapter D: emotional/relationship consequence
- Chapter E: resolution + next-hook

## 3) Milestone Cadence

- Every 10 chapters: one capability milestone (skill, rank, method, resource).
- Every 15-20 chapters: one relationship or ideology turning point.
- Every major arc: one irreversible cost.

## 4) Consistency Guardrails

- Keep cause-effect chain explicit.
- Keep power growth tied to prior setup.
- Avoid unexplained rescue or abrupt escalation without foreshadowing.

## 5) Handbook/Outline Editing Rules

- Convert vague goals into measurable events.
- Mark each milestone with trigger, conflict, cost, and aftermath.
- Keep early arcs denser; reduce filler between hooks.
