# Style Baseline

## 1) Dialogue

- Use direct dialogue lines first, then follow with action or reaction.
- Avoid repetitive dialogue tags in every line.
- Keep average dialogue line compact; split long exposition into turns.
- Use silence and gesture as beats, not only verbal explanation.

## 2) Inner Voice

- Keep inner voice concise and consequential.
- Prefer decision-oriented thought over repetitive commentary.
- Place inner voice at tactical moments: choice, fear, revelation, cost.

## 3) Paragraph Rhythm

- Keep mobile-friendly paragraph length.
- Alternate paragraph texture: action, sensation, thought, dialogue.
- Avoid back-to-back abstract exposition blocks.

## 4) Narrative Consistency

- Anchor each scene in one dominant viewpoint.
- Keep pronoun references unambiguous in group scenes.
- Convert author explanation into character-perceivable detail whenever possible.

## 5) Terminology Layering

- Native characters: use in-world language.
- System UI and protagonist cognition: allow explicit game/stat language.
- Do not let native character dialogue directly read game panels unless plot-justified.
